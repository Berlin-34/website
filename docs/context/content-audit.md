### Consistent Elements Across Pages
1. **Header Navigation:** Fixed header with logo, main nav, and Contact CTA button
2. **Footer:** Quick Links, Services, Contact Info, Social Links, Odoo Partner Badge

4. **"Let's talk about your project"** section appears in footer of most pages
5. **WhatsApp floating button** on all pages

## Recommendations for Redesign

### Content Consolidation
1. **Homepage services section** needs clearer labeling (currently mislabeled as "Graphic Designing Services")
2. **Career page title** needs to be fixed (currently shows "Contact KP Infotech")
3. **AI sections** are inconsistently added across service pages - standardize
4. **Case Studies** section needs more content (only 1 currently)

### Navigation Simplification
1. Current: 8 main nav items + dropdown
2. Proposed simplified structure:
   - Who We Are
   - Services (with submenu)
   - Industries
   - Success Stories
   - Contact

### Content Gaps to Address
1. No dedicated Industries page
2. Case studies not prominently featured (only 1 published)
3. Team/leadership details sparse
4. No client logos/trust badges on homepage
5. Limited social proof beyond testimonials carousel
6. Blog has no categories/filtering

### SEO Improvements Needed
1. Meta descriptions need to be added/verified
2. Page titles need consistency (Career page issue)
3. H1/H2 structure needs optimization
4. Schema markup should be added
5. Blog needs category taxonomy

### Technical Migration Notes
1. All pages use Elementor - will need content extraction
2. Contact forms will need recreation in new system
3. Testimonials slider needs component recreation
4. FAQ accordions use Elementor tabs
5. WhatsApp integration will need plugin replacement
