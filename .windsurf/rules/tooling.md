# Tooling Rules

- Use **Astro** for static site generation (SSG).
- Host on **Vercel** unless S3/CloudFront is needed for granular control.
- Use **TypeScript** throughout the project.
- Use **Zod** for form validation and type safety (if form validation needed).
- Use **React Hook Form** for managing complex forms.
