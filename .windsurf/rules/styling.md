# Styling Rules

- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes as the primary styling approach.
- For design systems and interactive components, use **shadcn/ui**.
- Do not write custom CSS unless necessary (place in `styles/` if needed).
- Prefer `rounded-2xl`, `p-4`, `text-xl`, `gap-4` for consistent spacing and layout.
- Maintain responsiveness using Tailwind breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, etc).
